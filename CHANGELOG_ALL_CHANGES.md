### [2.7.0] - 2026-07-12

#### Bug Fixes
- **Umlauts in device name no longer break energy sensor lookup** ([#93](https://github.com/GuidoJeuken-6512/lambda_heat_pumps/issues/93)): When the integration's device name contained umlauts (e.g. `Wärmepumpe`), the internal fallback lookup for the own energy consumption sensor always returned `None`. Home Assistant's entity registry silently transliterates umlauts on first entity creation (e.g. `ä` → `a`), so the actual entity ID was `sensor.warmepumpe_hp1_…` while the lookup constructed `sensor.wärmepumpe_hp1_…`. A new helper function `slugify_name_prefix_for_lookup()` now applies the same transliteration for read-only state lookups, so the names match. The fix is limited to the two read-only lookup sites (`coordinator.py`); all `unique_id`-generating paths remain unchanged to avoid orphaning existing entities.

---

### [2.6.0] - 2026-06-24

#### New Features
- **Cooling Circuit Climate Entity**: New `climate.<prefix>_hc<n>_cooling_circuit` entity per detected heating circuit, analogous to the existing `heating_circuit` climate entity. Shares the same current-temperature source (room device temperature) as `heating_circuit`, but writes its setpoint to the dedicated cooling setpoint register (offset 52, e.g. register 5052 for HC1, 5152 for HC2, …). Disabled by default — enable via the new `cooling_mode_enabled` option in the integration's Options Flow.

---

### [2.5.0] - 2026-04-16

Pure code quality and stability release — no breaking changes, no impact on `unique_id`, `entity_id`, or `sensor_id`.

#### Fixed
- **Race condition in reload flag** (K-01): Fast-path now uses `lock.locked()` (atomic) to close a TOCTOU gap in `async_reload_entry()`
- **Background auto-detection exception logging** (K-02, fixes #80): Level raised to `WARNING` with full traceback (`exc_info=True`)
- **Modbus locks bound to wrong event loop** (K-03): Lazy initialization — locks are created on first call, not at module import
- **Entity registry listener without debounce** (H-01): 250 ms debounce prevents redundant parallel mapping updates
- **Non-atomic sensor ID update** (H-02): Local copies + atomic swap eliminates inconsistent intermediate state
- **Persist data lost on shutdown** (H-03): `_persist_counters(force=True)` called on unload to flush within the debounce window
- **Climate state inconsistency on write error** (H-04): Explicit `None` check before local state update; refresh on failure
- **Fragile JSON repair logic** (M-01): Regex-based repair removed; backup-and-reset strategy for corrupted persist files
- **Modbus batch size too close to protocol limit** (M-02): Limit lowered from 120 to 100 registers (safe margin below the 125-register maximum)
- **Missing temperature range validation** (M-03): `min_temp >= max_temp` now falls back to defaults with a warning
- **Persist file missing version field** (M-04): `"version": 1` written to all new persist files

#### Code Quality
- Log levels corrected (`INFO` → `WARNING`/`DEBUG`) for connection errors and health-check results (Q-01)
- ~110 lines of hardcoded INT32 debug code for registers 1020/1022 removed (Q-02)
- Dead-code method `_generate_entity_id()` removed (Q-03)
- Log-prefix constants defined in `__init__.py` (Q-04); inline imports moved to file top (Q-05)

#### Dependencies
- `pymodbus` 3.9.2 → 3.13.0 · `packaging` ≥23.1 → ≥26.0 · `homeassistant` ≥2025.10 → ≥2026.2.3 (test)

---

### [2.4.0] - 2026-03-29
 
#### Fixed
- **Critical: Cycling offset re-applied on every cycle event**: `increment_cycling_counter()` was re-adding the full `cycling_offsets` YAML value on every detected mode change instead of once at startup. Offset logic removed from this function; sole responsibility now lies with `_apply_cycling_offset()` in `sensor.py`, which correctly uses differential tracking.
- **Mode detection for cycling counters**: Fixed shared-state bug that caused cycle events to be missed.
- **NameError in `increment_cycling_counter()`**: Operating mode transitions were detected but never counted due to a `cycling_entity` NameError.
- **Energy offsets silently ignored**: `_apply_energy_offset()` was never called from `async_added_to_hass()`, causing configured energy offsets to have no effect at HA startup.

#### Improvements
- Configuration template (`lambda_wp_config.yaml`) extended with examples for negative offsets and thermal energy offset keys.
- Migration system updated; 23 new tests added covering offset scenarios.
- Documentation updated: negative offset usage documented, stale warning banners removed.

### [2.3.4] - 2026-03-21
Change to the logic for detecting compressor starts (cycling): The 'compressor_unit_rating' sensor is used and is queried more frequently.

### [2.3] - 2026-03-01

> ⚠️ **Before upgrading**: Create a backup of your Home Assistant configuration. This release contains a breaking change that may alter entity IDs under certain conditions.

#### Breaking Changes
- **Name Prefix Normalization**: The configured `name_prefix` is now automatically converted to lowercase with spaces removed. 

#### New Features
- **COP Sensors** (Heating / Cooling / Hot Water): New sensors for the Coefficient of Performance — hourly, daily, monthly, and total periods. Calculated from thermal energy output and electrical consumption.
- **Thermal Energy Consumption Sensors**: Tracks heat output per heat pump — daily, monthly, total, and yesterday. Can optionally use an external heat meter as source sensor via `lambda_wp_config.yaml` (`thermal_sensor_entity_id`).
- **Flow Line Temperature Setpoint Sensor**: New sensor `hp_flow_line_temperature_setpoint` for the calculated flow temperature target value.
- **Compressor Start Cycling Yesterday**: New sensor `compressor_start_cycling_yesterday` for yesterday's compressor start count.

#### Fixed
- **Compressor Start Cycle Counter**: Counter now triggers on HP-State `2` (RESTART-BLOCK) instead of `5` (START COMPRESSOR). RESTART-BLOCK is the lockout state entered after a completed compressor run — counting here means counting completed cycles, not started ones.
- **Entity Duplicate Cleanup**: Sensors with `config_parameter_` in their name were falsely detected as HA duplicates by the `_\d+$` regex (e.g. `config_parameter_24` ends in `_24`). These sensors are now skipped in both cleanup passes.
- **Energy Consistency**: Daily, monthly, and yearly energy values are now validated on restore and reset — a previous-period value can never exceed the current total, preventing negative consumption differences.
- **Reset Sequence**: Yesterday sensors are now updated before the daily counter reset, ensuring `_yesterday` always reflects the actual prior-day value.
- **Energy Calculation**: Daily/monthly/yearly deltas now read baseline values directly from registered HA entities instead of internal variables, avoiding inconsistencies after reloads.
- **Modbus int16 Conversion**: Fixed signed-to-unsigned conversion for 16-bit registers (Two's Complement). New helper `clamp_to_int16` prevents overflow.
- **Room Thermostat Offset**: Corrected configurable offset range and Modbus conversion for signed values.
- **Maximum Boiler Temperature**: Removed from sensor templates — it reads the same Modbus register as `target_high_temperature`.

#### Improvements
- **Internal Refactoring**: `const.py` split into three focused modules (`const_base.py`, `const_sensor.py`, `const_calculated_sensors.py`); per-entry reload locks replacing a single global lock; f-string logging replaced with HA-compliant `%s` format; redundant `_unique_id` attributes removed from sensor classes.

---

  - **Mid Point**: Defines the heating curve at medium outside temperatures
  - **Warm Point**: Defines the heating curve at high outside temperatures
  - **New Sensor**: `heating_curve_flow_line_temperature_calc` automatically calculates the optimal flow temperature based on current outside temperature and the configured support points
- **Compressor Start Cycling Sensor**: Added new cycling sensor for tracking compressor start events
  - **Total Sensor**: `compressor_start_cycling_total` - Tracks total compressor starts since installation
  - **Daily Sensor**: `compressor_start_cycling_daily` - Tracks daily compressor starts (resets at midnight)
  - **2H Sensor**: `compressor_start_cycling_2h` - Tracks 2-hour compressor starts (resets every 2 hours)
  - **4H Sensor**: `compressor_start_cycling_4h` - Tracks 4-hour compressor starts (resets every 4 hours)
  - **Monthly Sensor**: `compressor_start_cycling_monthly` - Tracks monthly compressor starts (resets on 1st of month)
  - **Flank Detection**: Uses HP_STATE register (1002) instead of HP_OPERATING_STATE, detecting "START COMPRESSOR" state (value 5)

#### Improvements

#### Changed
- **Register Order Values**: Changed configuration values from `"big"`/`"little"` to `"high_first"`/`"low_first"` for better clarity
  - Old values (`big`/`little`) are still supported with automatic conversion
  - New default is `"high_first"` (replaces `"big"`)
  - Improved documentation and comments to clarify register order vs. byte endianness

#### Improvements
- Test optimization: 57 tests successfully repaired and optimized

### [1.2.2] - 2025-08-18

#### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE - BACKUP REQUIRED

This release contains significant changes to the Entity Registry and sensor naming conventions. **Please create a complete backup of your Home Assistant configuration before updating.**

**What will change:**
- Automatic migration of existing sensor entities to prevent duplicates
- Updated unique_id format for better consistency
- Sensor filtering based on firmware compatibility

**After migration, please verify:**
- Sensor names and long-term data are preserved correctly
- No duplicate entities exist in your system
- All sensors are functioning as expected
- **Automations may need to be updated** if they reference sensor entities that were migrated

**A Copy of the core.config_entries, core.device_registry and core.entity_registry is created before the sensors are migrated and can be copied back from the /lambda_heat_pumps folder to the hidden .storage folder to undo the changes. However, version 1.0.9 of the integration must then be reinstalled for the system to work properly.**

---

> **📚 Dokumentation**: Eine deutsche Dokumentation wird derzeit unter [https://guidojeuken-6512.github.io/lambda_heat_pumps](https://guidojeuken-6512.github.io/lambda_heat_pumps) aufgebaut

### [2.7.0] - 2026-07-12

#### Fehlerbehebungen
- **Umlaute im Gerätenamen führen nicht mehr zu fehlgeschlagenem Energie-Sensor-Lookup** ([#93](https://github.com/GuidoJeuken-6512/lambda_heat_pumps/issues/93)): Enthielt der Gerätename der Integration Umlaute (z. B. `Wärmepumpe`), lieferte der interne Fallback-Lookup für den eigenen Energieverbrauchs-Sensor stets `None`. Home Assistants Entity Registry transliteriert Umlaute beim ersten Anlegen einer Entity intern (z. B. `ä` → `a`), sodass die tatsächliche Entity-ID `sensor.warmepumpe_hp1_…` lautete, der Lookup aber `sensor.wärmepumpe_hp1_…` konstruierte. Eine neue Hilfsfunktion `slugify_name_prefix_for_lookup()` wendet nun dieselbe Transliteration für rein lesende Status-Lookups an, sodass die Namen übereinstimmen. Der Fix beschränkt sich auf die zwei rein lesenden Lookup-Stellen (`coordinator.py`); alle `unique_id`-erzeugenden Pfade bleiben unverändert, um bestehende Entities nicht zu verwaisen.

---

### [2.6.0] - 2026-06-24

#### Neue Funktionen
- **Kühlkreis-Climate-Entity**: Neue Entity `climate.<prefix>_hc<n>_cooling_circuit` je erkanntem Heizkreis, analog zur bestehenden `heating_circuit`-Climate-Entity. Nutzt dieselbe Quelle für die Ist-Temperatur (Raum-Gerätetemperatur) wie `heating_circuit`, schreibt den Sollwert aber auf das dedizierte Kühl-Sollwert-Register (Offset 52, z. B. Register 5052 für HC1, 5152 für HC2, …). Standardmäßig deaktiviert — Aktivierung über die neue Option `cooling_mode_enabled` im Options-Flow der Integration.

---

### [2.5.0] - 2026-04-16

Reines Code-Qualitäts- und Stabilitätsrelease — keine Breaking Changes, keine Auswirkung auf `unique_id`, `entity_id` oder `sensor_id`.

#### Behoben
- **Race Condition im Reload-Flag** (K-01): Fast-Path verwendet jetzt `lock.locked()` (atomar) — TOCTOU-Lücke in `async_reload_entry()` geschlossen
- **Exception-Logging im Auto-Detection-Task** (K-02, behebt #80): Log-Level auf `WARNING` + `exc_info=True` für vollständigen Traceback angehoben
- **Modbus-Locks an falschen Event-Loop gebunden** (K-03): Lazy-Initialization — Locks werden erst beim ersten Aufruf erstellt, nicht mehr beim Modul-Import
- **Entity-Registry-Listener ohne Debounce** (H-01): 250 ms Debounce verhindert redundante parallele Mapping-Updates
- **Nicht-atomares Sensor-ID-Update** (H-02): Lokale Kopien + atomarer Tausch eliminieren inkonsistente Zwischenzustände
- **Persist-Datenverlust beim Shutdown** (H-03): `_persist_counters(force=True)` beim Unload flusht Daten innerhalb des Debounce-Fensters
- **Climate State-Inkonsistenz bei Write-Fehler** (H-04): Explizite `None`-Prüfung vor lokalem State-Update; Refresh bei Fehler
- **Fragile JSON-Repair-Logik** (M-01): Regex-Reparatur entfernt; Backup-und-Reset-Strategie bei korrupten Persist-Dateien
- **Modbus-Batch-Größe zu nah am Protokoll-Limit** (M-02): Limit von 120 auf 100 Register gesenkt (sicherer Puffer unter dem Maximum von 125)
- **Fehlende Temperaturbereich-Validierung** (M-03): `min_temp >= max_temp` wird erkannt und mit Warnung auf Defaults zurückgefallen
- **Fehlendes Versionsfeld in der Persist-Datei** (M-04): `"version": 1` wird in alle neuen Persist-Dateien geschrieben

#### Code-Qualität
- Log-Level in `modbus_utils.py` und `coordinator.py` korrigiert (`INFO` → `WARNING`/`DEBUG`) (Q-01)
- ~110 Zeilen hardcodierter INT32-Debug-Code für Register 1020/1022 entfernt (Q-02)
- Dead-Code-Methode `_generate_entity_id()` entfernt (Q-03)
- Log-Präfix-Konstanten in `__init__.py` definiert (Q-04); Inline-Imports an Dateianfang verschoben (Q-05)

#### Abhängigkeiten
- `pymodbus` 3.9.2 → 3.13.0 · `packaging` ≥23.1 → ≥26.0 · `homeassistant` ≥2025.10 → ≥2026.2.3 (Test)

---

### [2.4.0] - 2026-03-29

#### Behoben
- **Kritisch: Cycling-Offset wurde bei jedem Zyklus erneut addiert**: `increment_cycling_counter()` hat den in `lambda_wp_config.yaml` konfigurierten `cycling_offsets`-Wert bei jeder erkannten Modusänderung neu aufaddiert statt einmalig beim Start. Die Offset-Logik wurde aus dieser Funktion entfernt; alleinige Verantwortung liegt jetzt bei `_apply_cycling_offset()` in `sensor.py`, das korrekt mit Differenz-Tracking arbeitet.
- **Moduserkennung für Cycling-Zähler**: Fehler durch gemeinsam genutzten Zustand behoben, der dazu führte, dass Zyklusereignisse nicht erkannt wurden.
- **NameError in `increment_cycling_counter()`**: Betriebsmodus-Übergänge wurden zwar erkannt, aber wegen eines `cycling_entity`-NameErrors nie gezählt.
- **Energie-Offsets wurden lautlos ignoriert**: `_apply_energy_offset()` wurde nicht aus `async_added_to_hass()` aufgerufen, sodass konfigurierte Energie-Offsets beim HA-Start keine Wirkung hatten.

#### Verbesserungen
- Konfigurations-Template (`lambda_wp_config.yaml`) um Beispiele für negative Offsets und thermische Energie-Offset-Schlüssel erweitert.
- Migrationssystem aktualisiert; 23 neue Tests für Offset-Szenarien hinzugefügt.
- Dokumentation aktualisiert: Verwendung negativer Offsets dokumentiert, veraltete Warnhinweise entfernt.

---

### [2.3.4] - 2026-03-21
Änderung an der Logik zur Erkennung von Kompressorstarts (Cycling): Der Sensor `compressor_unit_rating` wird verwendet und häufiger abgefragt.

---

### [2.3] - 2026-XX-XX

> ⚠️ **Vor dem Update**: Erstelle ein Backup deiner Home Assistant Konfiguration (Verzeichnis `config/`) sowie der `lambda_wp_config.yaml`. Dieses Release enthält einen Breaking Change, der Entity-IDs verändern kann.

#### Breaking Changes
- **Name-Prefix-Normalisierung**: Der konfigurierte `name_prefix` wird ab sofort automatisch in Kleinbuchstaben umgewandelt und Leerzeichen werden entfernt. Wer einen Prefix mit Großbuchstaben oder Leerzeichen verwendet hatte (z. B. `"EU08L"` oder `"Lambda WP"`), bekommt geänderte Entity-IDs — bestehende Automationen, Dashboards und Template-Sensoren müssen angepasst werden.

#### Neue Funktionen
- **COP-Sensoren** (Heizen / Kühlen / Warmwasser): Neue Sensoren für die Arbeitszahl — stündlich, täglich, monatlich und gesamt. Berechnung aus thermischem Energieertrag und elektrischem Verbrauch.
- **Thermische Energieverbrauchs-Sensoren**: Tracking der Wärmeabgabe pro Wärmepumpe — täglich, monatlich, gesamt und gestern. Optional kann ein externer Wärmemengenzähler als Quellsensor konfiguriert werden (`thermal_sensor_entity_id` in `lambda_wp_config.yaml`).
- **Vorlauftemperatur-Sollwert-Sensor**: Neuer Sensor `hp_flow_line_temperature_setpoint` für den berechneten Vorlauf-Sollwert.
- **Kompressorstarts Gestern**: Neuer Sensor `compressor_start_cycling_yesterday` für die Kompressorstarts des Vortags.

#### Behoben
- **Kompressorstart-Zähler**: Der Zähler löst jetzt bei HP-State `2` (RESTART-BLOCK) statt bei `5` (START COMPRESSOR) aus. RESTART-BLOCK ist der Sperrzeit-Zustand nach einem abgeschlossenen Kompressorlauf — damit werden abgeschlossene Zyklen gezählt, nicht gestartete.
- **Duplikat-Cleanup**: Sensoren mit `config_parameter_` im Namen wurden vom Regex `_\d+$` fälschlicherweise als HA-Duplikate erkannt (z. B. endet `config_parameter_24` auf `_24`). Diese Sensoren werden jetzt in beiden Cleanup-Phasen übersprungen.
- **Energie-Konsistenz**: Tages-, Monats- und Jahreswerte werden beim Restore und Reset geprüft — ein Vorperiodenwert kann den aktuellen Gesamtwert nicht übersteigen, damit keine negativen Differenzen entstehen.
- **Reset-Reihenfolge**: Gestern-Sensoren werden jetzt vor dem täglichen Reset aktualisiert, sodass `_yesterday` immer dem tatsächlichen Vortageswert entspricht.
- **Energieberechnung**: Differenzwerte werden jetzt direkt aus den HA-Entities gelesen statt aus internen Variablen — verhindert Inkonsistenzen nach Reloads.
- **Modbus int16-Konvertierung**: Korrektur der Vorzeichen-Konvertierung für 16-Bit-Register (Two's Complement). Neue Hilfsfunktion `clamp_to_int16` verhindert Überlauf.
- **Raumthermostat-Offset**: Offset-Bereich und Modbus-Konvertierung für vorzeichenbehaftete Werte korrigiert.

#### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES IN DIESER VERSION - BACKUP ERFORDERLICH

Diese Version enthält wesentliche Änderungen an der Entity Registry und den Sensor-Namenskonventionen. **Bitte erstellen Sie ein vollständiges Backup Ihrer Home Assistant-Konfiguration vor dem Update.**

**Was sich ändern wird:**
- Automatische Migration bestehender Sensor-Entities zur Vermeidung von Duplikaten
- Aktualisiertes unique_id-Format für bessere Konsistenz
- Sensor-Filterung basierend auf Firmware-Kompatibilität

**Nach der Migration bitte überprüfen:**
- Sensor-Namen und Langzeitdaten sind korrekt erhalten
- Keine doppelten Entities in Ihrem System vorhanden
- Alle Sensoren funktionieren wie erwartet
- **Automatisierungen müssen möglicherweise aktualisiert werden**, wenn sie auf migrierte Sensor-Entities verweisen

**Eine Kopie der core.config_entries, core.device_registry und core.entity_registry wird vor der Sensor-Migration erstellt und kann aus dem /lambda_heat_pumps-Ordner in den versteckten .storage-Ordner kopiert werden, um die Änderungen rückgängig zu machen. Allerdings muss dann Version 1.0.9 der Integration neu installiert werden, damit das System ordnungsgemäß funktioniert.**
